# Coding Challenges

This repo contains my solutions to the Challenges on the [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) website. My aim in doing this is to improve my Go coding skills.

Specifically
* I want to familiarise myself with the standard library
* I would like to learn how to write idiomatic Go code 
* I want to bild up a good understanding of best practices around testing/benchmarking and fuzzing in Go

## Challenges

1. Build a wc clone (solution in wc)
2. Build a JSON parser which can be used to validate JSON (solution in jp)

## Code reviews

* Make sure tests pass
* Run any linters
* Check the solution meets the brief
* The code should be readable, testable, idiomatic and reasonably performant
